### Code Refactoring
- **Refactor `readBoard` Logic**:  
  Move the logic inside `readBoard` to a separate classâ€”similar to the original `BoardFactory` class from Assignment 1.  
  This class can be defined either as an inner class within `Manager`, or as an independent class.  
  The `readBoard` method must remain a `Manager` function, but should simply delegate to this new board creation class.

### Code Quality
- **Review All `TODO`s in `Manager`**:  
  Go through and resolve all `TODO` comments in the `Manager` source file.

- **Constant Usage**:  
  Revisit and correct usage of `const` for variables and functions to ensure best practices are followed.

### Code Reuse
- **Salvage Logic from `GameManager`**:  
  Reuse any valuable logic or structure from the original `GameManager` implementation.

### Design Considerations
- **Clarify Roles**:  
  Clearly define the difference between an *Algorithm* and a *Player* in our system.

- **Understand Factory Responsibilities**:
  - Why do we have both Algorithm and Player factories?
  - Should these factories create instances based on `PlayerID` or `TankID`?
  - Should each player have its own dedicated factory?

### Memory Management
- **Fix Board Instantiation**:  
  Eliminate the use of raw `new` for the board.  
  Consider using smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr`) to manage memory safely and efficiently.
