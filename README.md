# Tank Battle Simulator – Tel Aviv University

A modular and deterministic tank battle simulator developed as part of the “Advanced Topics in Programming” course at TAU.  
The project evolved through three stages — from a simple two-player game to a full simulator supporting dynamic managers, algorithms, and competitive tournaments.

## Highlights
- Implemented a **multi-module C++ system**: `Simulator`, `GameManager`, `Algorithm`, and shared `UserCommon` utilities.
- Designed **threaded simulation** supporting **comparative** and **competitive** modes with dynamically loaded `.so` modules.
- Built a robust **logging, input validation, and error-handling** framework.
- Developed **strategic tank algorithms** implementing offensive and defensive movement and shooting logic.
- Created an extensible architecture for automated testing, multiple managers, and cross-module communication.

## Technologies
C++, Make, POSIX threads, dynamic linking (`.so`), and modular build system.
